Hello everyone, I'm `smraisul03` or S M Raisul Alam-Bhuiyan, although you can call be Raisul. 

This place is my little corner on the internet where I get to share some of my projects, as well as my experiences within the world, and building. 

In my freetimes you can catch me reading, playing video games, listening to music, or planning out the course of my future. I also have a list of [Books](/books/) that I've read thus far. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me through various means. Thank you for visiting my little corner of the internet, and I hope you're having a wonderful day.
