Hello everyone, I'm `smraisul03` or S M Raisul Alam-Bhuiyan, although you can call me Raisul!

This place is my little corner on the internet where I get to share some of my projects, as well as my experiences within the world, and building. Currently what you may find are my programming projects alongside with my homelab build that I'm passionate about as well! 

In my freetimes you can catch me reading, playing video games, listening to music, or planning out the course of my future. You can check out what [Books](/books/) I've been reading so far. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me! Thank you for visiting my little corner of the internet, and I hope you're having a wonderful day.
