First off I am honored to say that I am a part of the Yellow Jackets community, and even more-so a part of a community that is in the same direction as I am in specializing for the future. I look forward to continuing my journey at Georgia Tech, and I am especially excited to start this program. 

I am starting for the Fall 2028 semester in the *Computing System* Specialization, where my focus I hope is going to be on distributed computing.
